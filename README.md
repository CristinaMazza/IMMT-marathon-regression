# Ironman Marathon Multiple Regression

Running a marathon (especially one within an Ironman triathlon) is hard work, but most people don't consider what makes it so hard besides getting really, really sore legs. A big part of what makes a marathon so difficult is the immense amount of energy that goes into covering the 42km distance. One way to measure how much energy is by heart rate, and many training plans quantify exercise intensity using heart rate, in beats per minute.

Using linear regression, I look at the factors driving my heart rate during my marathon at Ironman Mont Tremblant, using data collected by my Garmin Forerunner 935 watch. The dependent variables used are run cadence, stride length, and net ascent. The dataset is based on 1km run splits, so there are 42 data points. While more data would be ideal, it may have to wait until I get the courage to run a 100km+ ultramarathon.
